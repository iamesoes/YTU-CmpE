# Problem


**There is two button which control the Seven-segment display**

**When we press the button which connected to 8255's 4th end, it resets the display and shows zero.**

**Each time when we press the button which connected to 8255's zeroth end, it shows in order 5, 6, 7, 8. And after '8', it goes back to '5'.**



**Port A will be input, port B will be output.**

***8255's port A address is going to be 0300H.***
